## Limitations
- Made to work with English <â€“> Spanish characters by "folding" accents and special characters.
- Does not recognize contractions.
- Does not match spelled-out numbers with numerals.
- Punctuation of sentences needs to be the same for a possitive match.

## Notes
- The variable charMap is the one to change to support other languages.
- This is the first pass. The code may need some cleaning but it is functional.
